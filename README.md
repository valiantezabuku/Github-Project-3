# NYC Parking Ticket Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring the NYC parking ticket dataset, along with the accompanying CSV dataset.
## Description
In this project, I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing NYC parking ticket violations. I explored various aspects of the data, including but not limited to:

- The average fine amount for each violation type.
- Analysis of violation trends over time.
- Identification of common types of parking violations.
- Distribution of violation fines.

Using appropriate visualizations such as lineplots and bar charts, I highlighted key trends and insights gleaned from the data. This analysis aims to provide a better understanding of parking violations in NYC and identify potential areas for further investigation or intervention.
